## Details of assignment:

* How long you spent on the assignment.
- 4 Hours
* What you like about your implementation.
- I liked the logic that I applied for using an allocation context
* What you would change if you were going to do it again.
- I would separate the days and the events in specific lazy row with a scroll share
* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
- No, I didn't use any inspiration
* How you would test this if you had more time.
- Removing the SampleEvents and adding a paginated events list
* Any special instructions on how to build/run your app.
- No

* I wish I was faster when trying to find a logic for making the dates and events match the scroll
